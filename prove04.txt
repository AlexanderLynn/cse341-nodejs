After completing the assignment, be sure to push to Github. You do not have to worry about pushing to Heroku this lesson.
Please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
https://github.com/AlexanderLynn/cse341-nodejs

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. 
At this point the following is working:
- Node.js server
- Basic requestHandler
- NPM package manager
- Routes for "/", "admin/add-product", and a page not found (404)
- EJS tmeplating and rendering via express
- Data stored in a JSON file
- Forms for adding, editing, and deleting products
- A cart for our shop
- Creating user
- NoSQL database in MongoDB
- Orders and order retrieval based on user id

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
Good stopping point. Most of the basic functionality is working. Now the last major component for making something like this the minimum
viable product is user authentication and providing sessions.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
Honestly NoSQL was sweet. I ahve worked with AWS ElasticSearch quite a big and always wondered why items were stored in zips of documents.
It makes it easy to expand and store logs and access them quicker than creating alrge logging SQL databases.

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
I would not, so nothing to be changed!

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   4 - Meets requirements
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

Number 5!

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
The mongoDB section feels like he ran throught he code very quickly. I needed to slow down and figure out how to use each of the 
individual pieces. I also dove into promises and callbacks trying to understand my knowledge of how these work as they are critical
to undertanding and being more comofrtable writing better javascript.
