After completing the assignment, be sure to push to Github. You do not have to worry about pushing to Heroku this lesson.
Please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
https://github.com/AlexanderLynn/cse341-nodejs

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. 
At this point the following is working:
- Node.js server
- Basic requestHandler
- NPM package manager
- Routes for "/", "admin/add-product", and a page not found (404)
- EJS tmeplating and rendering via express
- Data stored in a JSON file
- Forms for adding, editing, and deleting products
- A cart for our shop
- Creating user
- NoSQL database in MongoDB
- Orders and order retrieval based on user id
- User creation and authentication
- Email on account creation
- CSRF protection in pages

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
Server side validation for pattern matching of any entered fields

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
CSRF protection and understanding how that is implemented was super cool! I had ever thought about injecting
a unique code in each page, but it makes sense. I made me think of the "state" property that is returned
when making an OAuth2 request in an API.

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
I wish we could have seen the backend for the csurf module. While It is much easier to include a module, it
is nice to see how that funcitons at lower level.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   4 - Meets requirements
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

Number 5!

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
Got the work done and trie to make sure I understood every piece before moving on. A short lessons, so not much repetition
was needed.
