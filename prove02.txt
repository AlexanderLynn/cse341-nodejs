After completing the assignment, be sure to push to Github. You do not have to worry about pushing to Heroku this lesson.
Please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
https://github.com/AlexanderLynn/cse341-nodejs

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. 
At this point the following is working:
- Node.js server
- Basic requestHandler
- NPM package manager
- Routes for "/", "admin/add-product", and a page not found (404)
- EJS tmeplating and rendering via express

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.


5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
Being able to use vanilla javascript code within an html page is fantastic. While I think I would prefer to write most of my logic
outside of the page, having the ability to insert variables dyanically is sweet!

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
I think the handlebars felt kind of like a waste of time. I would have prefered using the 25 minutes on learning some more high level
concepts or EJS syntax.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   4 - Meets requirements
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

Number 5!

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I took the time to really understand what was being performed in these sections and push myself on the challenges. Then I reviewed my
code with the instructors solutions.
